SUMMARY:
A command line mathematical expression evaluator and calculator.  
Accepts natural infix mathematical input, including support for functions and implicit multiplication.  
Is able to distinguish unary negation and binary subtraction.


EVALUATING EXPRESSIONS:
Enter a mathematical expression after the "> " symbol.  The result will appear below it.  
Ex:
> 5+5
  10.000000

Spaces will be ignored unless there is no operator between two values, in which case they are implicity multiplied
Implicit multiplication will also be performed if a parenthesis separates two values
Ex:
> 5.0 + 5.0
  10.000000

> 5 5
  25.000000

> 5(-5)
  -25.000000

Program follows order of operations (note that spaces here are used purely for visual clarity).
Ex: 
> 5^3.1^0.2 + 39.2^2 / (2(200-100))
  15.207352

A variety of functions are supported (see "SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS" section below).
Note that parentheses for single-argument functions are entirely optional.
Ex:
> sin 2
  0.909297

> sin(2)
  0.909297


CLOSE PROGRAM:
Enter "quit" to close the program.
Ex: 
> quit


SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
1 + 2        Addition
1 - 2        Subtraction
- 1          Negation
1 * 2        Multiplication
1 / 2        Division
1 ^ 2        Exponentiation


SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS:
idiv(1, 2)   Integer division (1 is divided by 2)
mod(1, 2)    Modulo (remainder of 1 divided by 2)
log(1, 2)    Logarithm (logarithm of 2, base 1) 
root(1, 2)   Root (root order 1 of 2)
sin(1)       Sine (Sine of 1 radian)


ERRORS:
"unrecognized token:"
  One or more unrecognized symbols or words were encountered.  The first of these is shown after the colon.
  Note that a maximum of five sequential characters can constitute a token

"overflow error"
  The input was too long, or resulted in too many operations or variables

"syntax error"
  All tokens were recognized, but one or more were used incorrectly
